  summary: "Cybersecurity & Network Specialist with 2.8 years of hands-on experience in FTTP (GPON) network planning and commissioning for British Telecom via Tata Consultancy Services.",
  fullBio: `I'm a passionate cybersecurity professional currently pursuing my MSc in Cybersecurity at the University of Hertfordshire, UK. With 2.8 years of real-world experience as a Network Design Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, I've designed and commissioned large-scale FTTP networks for British Telecom (Openreach).

My journey uniquely combines telecom infrastructure expertise with cutting-edge cybersecurity skills. I specialize in threat analysis, penetration testing, incident response, and ISO 27001/27005-aligned risk management. Currently on sabbatical to complete my master's degree, I'm actively preparing for CompTIA Security+ certification and upskilling in Agentic AI and emerging AI security tools.

My research focus centers on Zero-Day Exploit Detection using Machine Learning for critical infrastructure - bridging my networking background with advanced cyber defense techniques.`,
